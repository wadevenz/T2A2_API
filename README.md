## R1 Explain the problem that this app will solve, and explain how this app solves or addresses the problem.

On its face, creating a footy tipping API might appear that it tackles no significant purpose or goal. Instead, it seems to exist merely to make available basic AFL information allow the amusement of friends and colleagues for some light hearted fun and hard but friendly competition through tipping... and that is true. 

However, there is much to be said for the benefits of an easy-to-use, enjoyable tipping competition, especially in a safe and friendly environment where no money is exchanged. It enhances engagement with sport, encouraging even the most casual of fans to follow matches closely and discuss predictions with friends and colleagues. 

It fosters camaraderie and friendly competition among participants, leading to social interaction and bonding over shared interests. In a workplace, or community setting, it also enhances morale by bringing colleagues together over a shared activity.

I have utilised such applications in the past, and I have enjoyed the friendly competition it creates, as it enhances the thrill of the match and creates lively conversations amongst pals. And it appears I'm not alone, as Barrett disccusses that a friendly tipping competition can engage inclusivity and foster communication in the workplace (Barrett, 2018).

Therefore the simple objectiove of this API application is to give AFL fans access to a live database of basic AFL information, including teams, locations, matches and give the option to make selections on the team they believe will win in upcoming matches. Simple in theory, effective in practice. Users have limited ability to manipulate data in the database as most requests are for admin authorisation only. This simplifies the application to give users access to information and the ability to make and update selections. And yet while it may seem that without reward or fincancial incentive, the selection process appears redundant, the reward is the enhanced thrill of following your chosen selection and the competitve incentive to beat your fellow associates.

## R2 Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/vHCD0owm/t2a2api)

The planning and project allocation tool I used for this application was trello. The software provides templates with which gives a good indication of desirable workflow.

Tasks are split up into 5 cards; Brainstorm, Todo, Doing and Done. As this was a similar task to undertake as had been previously seen, most tasks were automatically assigned to the 'Todo' card at the beginning. However as this was a first time solo project of this nature, inevitably other tasks were assigned as they were presented along the timeline of the project.

If the task was large enough, sub tasks were added within them in the form of checklists. This enabled effective breakdown of tasks and also mitigated the risk of leaving some tasks undone. 

Significant tasks were also given target completion dates, which highlighted their importance and enabled better planning.

## R3 List and explain the third-party services, packages and dependencies used in this app.

### Flask

Flask is a Python web applcation Framework that can be used to design API's, hence used in this project. Its popularity stems from its simplicity, versatility and self capability, meaning it has no external requirements and therefore works as an effective framework for this project written in the Python language. 

Python Software Foundation, 2024, PyPi, Flask 3.0.3, https://pypi.org/project/Flask/

### SQLAlchemy

As this application is utilising a relational database management system, PostgreSQL, the Object Relational Mapper and Python toolkit of SQLalchemy allows the relationship structure and schemas of the database to be mapped effectively on to the objects written in Python.

SQLAlchemy, viewed Jul 2024, https://www.sqlalchemy.org/

### Psycopg2

Using the Python language, the most common connection to the PostgreSQL database is via the database adapter of psycopg2. Its versatile and secure and works efficienty to match Python data types to PostgreSQL types. 

Python Software Foundation, 2024, pscopg2 2.9.9, https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/

### Bcrypt

Bcrypt is a function that utilises cryptographics to hash a password, and then stores it in a back end for the purpose of significantly increasing password protection and data safety. 

Python Software Foundation, 2024, bcrypt 4.2.0, https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/

### Marshmallow

Marshmallow is the 'middle-man' Python library, that enables the serialistaion and deserialisation of JSON data in our Flask application. It allows the JSON data types requested and sent from the front end to be read and validated, and manipulated into desired structures or schemas within the application.

Bharathwaj N, 2023, Marshmallow with Python Flask,https://medium.com/@nithinbharathwaj/marshmallow-with-python-flask-263e1fd5911f

### JWT Manager

Authorisation for interaction with data in this application is achieve using the common JSON Web Tokens. To do this more effectively the Javascript library JWT Mangager was installed.

### dotenv

The python-dotenv package allows the program to read key-value pair variables from ```.env``` files. This has been used to store sensive data contained with the URI and a secret JWT key. 

Python Software Foundation, 2024, python-dotenv 1.0.1, https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/

### Time/Date/Timezone libraries

A few modules and libraries have been installed to be able to access the databases and implement certain time and date variables within the application. These packages include; datetime, ZoneInfo and pytz.

## R4 Explain the benefits and drawbacks of this appâ€™s underlying database system.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL was the database system used for this application. It is an open source program that operates as an object-relational database management system. As this applications data suits an object structure of tables with columns that maintains relationships with other entities, the feature rich PostgreSQL fulfils the applications requirements well. Below is a brief outline of the database systems advantages and disadvantages. 

#### Benefits
**Object orientation** - As just mentioned, data stored in table structures with defined attributes and the ability to define comlex data types is a benefit, especially if designing a suitable application. Also within these data relationships is an inheritance structure which is important in object orientation (Ellingwood, 2024). 

**ACID compliance** - ACID refers to standards that are aimed to achieve maximum data validity and integrity when interacting with a database (Elligwood,2024). Its an acronym that can be explained through the folowing values:
 - **Atomicity** - Refers to indvisible transactions that maintain the function of all operations within that transaction. A transaction should and will not be finalised incomplete. 
 - **Consistency** - If data transitions through states, then the data integrity will be complete and maintained as it was pre transition. 
 - **Isolation** - Refers to data integrity being maintained through interactions as if every transaction was executed in sequential order.
 - **Durability** - Maintains all completed transactions through database failure or error. 
 
(Timescale, 2024)

**Conforms to SQL standards** - Compared to other similar systems, its increased adherence to SQL standards improves implementation of SQL functionality (Ellingwood, 2024)

**Open Source** - PostgreSQL is a popular open source project, which gives the benefit of a range of contrbutions to the development process (Ellingwood, 2024). Howver as seen below, open source may have some disadvantages. 

#### Drawbacks

**Open Source** - This can be a negative due to numerous owners rather than a single driving coorporate entity. Its broad input may have lead to poorer initial distribution and may also need higher clarity to maintain user friendliness. Also unlike other open source competitors PostgreSQL is not supported by as many market platforms and can suffer from compatability issues with some users(Ambarder, 2024). 

**Poor efficiency** - Compared to its closest competitor, the execution of concurrent dependencies can lead to decreased performance, especially if comparing to MySQL (Ambarder, 2024).

## R5 Explain the features, purpose and functionalities of the object-relational mapping system (ORM) used in this app.

### SQLALChemy

**ORM purpose**

As this application utilises OOP or Object Oriented Programming, a bridge is required from the code of the application to the structure and schema of the database. We need software to act as a layer in between the two to help communicate and create the desired goal, this software is referred to as Object Relational Mapping. As discussed, our database management system is PostgreSQL, and our application is built within a Python framework. A popular and functional ORM for this purpose is SQLAlchemy. Discussed below are some key features and an example of its functionality within the application (Ellingwood, 2024).

**Features**

Function-based query construction - A significant feature, especially for this application is to allow functions, objects or expressions in Python language to construct SQL queries, which is important for simple and efficient implementation. 

Seperate mapping and class design - Like other ORMs it allows classes defined by a user to be mapped inline with table data utilising a "'Decalrative' configurational system" (SQLAlchemy,2024). Uniquely however it isolates this functionality into seperate implementations through the use of function.

Other features of SQLAlchemy include representing primary and foreign keys as sets of columns and also including composite primary keys. As well as a mature architecture and self referential object mapping, there is the ability for single and joined table inheritance. SQLAlchemy supports the retrieval of multiple inherited types from a single query
(SQLAlchemy, 2024)

**Functionality**

An important functional tool in this application is in mapping models for the database. 
An example of how this mapping is utilised in this app can be seen in the use of classes and subclasses in creating tables with attributes as columns in the database.

```db = SQLAlchemy()```
```def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    db.init_app(app)
```
First of all the app is created via a "Declarative Base" class and SQLAlchemy is instantiated to be utilised to create the example model with the table named "teams" as seen below.
```
class Team(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "teams"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
```
This subclass Team can also be given attributes states as a column as seen above. 

SQLAlchemy is also used within the app to show relationships between Models using primary and foreign keys. Below shows an example from the Tip model, showing a many to one relationship with the Match model.

```tips = db.relationship("Tip", back_populates="matches")```

Using the tool of SQLAlchemy effectively allows the appropriate translation from the framework of our app to the design and structure of the database in the end to allow us to make effective routes or endpoints to retrieve the data from the front end. 


SQLAlchemy, 2024, Features and Philosophy, https://www.sqlalchemy.org/features.html

Ellingwood J, 2024, What is an ORM? https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/what-is-an-orm#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20ORMs%20serve%20as,from%20your%20language%20of%20choice.

## R6 Design an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this appâ€™s database, and explain how the relations between the diagrammed models will aid the database design. This should focus on the database design BEFORE coding has begun, eg. during the project planning or design phase.

![ERD](/docs/T2A2_ERD.png)

### User Table
The 'user' table represents a users attributes. The primary key is the serial id, with 4 other attributes. This table has a one-to-many relationship with the 'tip' table which will be discussed further below. 

### Tip Table
This table represents the tip/s from a user. The serial id is its primary key. This table is necessary as selections or tips directly from a user onto a match would require a many-to-many relationship from user to match. Therfore it was created with seperate many-to-one relationships. The crows foot annotation from the foreign key of 'user_id' to the user table primary key represents that one user may make many tips, however each tip can only belong to a single user. Similarly the foreign key of match_id related to match table primary key represents that each match may be associated with many tips, a single tip can only be placed onto a single match. 

### Match Table
This table represents matches played with mulitple attributes and multiple relationships. There are 3 foreign keys within this table, location_id; home_team; and away_team. The location_id represents a one-to-many relationship to the 'location' table, where each match is played at one and only one location, where a single location may have many matches played there. The crows foot annotation also displays that while many matches may be played at each location, there may be some locations that have no matches played there. 

### Team Table
This table simply stores the team data. The primary key is the serial id, and it is related via a one-to-many relationship to 2 seperate foreign keys on the 'match' table, the 'home_team' and 'away_team'. This is because both the home and away teams are stored within the team table. Each team may be associated with many matches, however for each match, either the 'home_team' or 'away_team' can only be associated with one 'team_id', as is depicted in the ERD. 

## R7 Explain the implemented models and their relationships, including how the relationships aid the database implementation.This should focus on the database implementation AFTER coding has begun, eg. during the project development phase.

### User Model

```
class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False, unique=True)
    password = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

    tips = db.relationship("Tip", back_populates="users")
```
The above mode represents a User entity as a table named "users". Each attribute is setup as a column within the table in the database.
- 'id' is set as an integer data type and also designated the primary key.
- 'name' is set as a string data type, it has a character limit of 100, and it cannot be left without a value.
- 'email' is also set as a string data type and must not be left empty. It also is stipulated that it must be unique from any other users 'email' stored in the database. 
- 'password' is also a string data type, and must be given a value. 
- 'is_admin' is a boolean type and is given a default value of false. 

The users table shares a relationship with the table 'tips'. Using the relationship method in the ORM we identify the model 'Tip" and substantiate the relationship with the "users" table by using "back_populates".

### Match Model
```
class Match(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "matches"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    round = db.Column(db.String)
    time = db.Column(db.DateTime)
    winner = db.Column(db.String)
    
    location_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("locations.id"), nullable=False)
    home_team_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("teams.id"), nullable=False)
    away_team_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("teams.id"), nullable=False)

    locations = db.relationship("Location", back_populates="matches")
    home_team = db.relationship("Team", foreign_keys=[home_team_id])
    away_team = db.relationship("Team", foreign_keys=[away_team_id])
    
    tips = db.relationship("Tip", back_populates="matches")
```
The Match model is represented by the table with the name "matches". It contains the data from each match. The columns within the table are as follows:
- 'id' is set as an integer type and the primary key. 
- 'round' is set as a string. This will mostly show numerical characters representing the current round, however it has been set to a string for alternate alpha characters such as "Grand Final"
- 'time' set to a datetime object and is to represent the time of each match.
- 'winner' set to a string type, and has a tuple of valid strings to choose from validated within the schema. 
- 'location_id' an integer type and a foreign key associated to the id of the 'locations' table. As its a foreign key it also must have a value. 
- 'home_team_id' an integer type and a foreign key associated to the id of the 'teams' table. As its a foreign key it also must have a value. 
- 'away_team_id' an integer type and a foreign key associated to the id of the 'teams' table. As its a foreign key it also must have a value. 

There are also multiple relationships that need to be created with other tables within the database.
- 'locations' creates a relationship with the 'Location' model and completes the relationship with back populating the 'matches' table.
- 'tips' creates a relationship with the 'Tip' model and completes the relationship with back populating the 'matches' table. 
- 'home_team' and 'away_team' are both foreign keys associated with a single primary key within the 'Team' model. The completion of this relationship will be discussed in the 'Team Model' 

### Team Model
```
class Team(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "teams"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, unique=True)
    stadium = db.Column(db.String)

    matches = relationship('Match', primaryjoin="or_(Team.id==Match.home_team_id, Team.id==Match.away_team_id)", viewonly=True)
```
The 'Team' model was created to store team data. Its table was named "teams". The following objects make up its columns.
- 'id' is the sserial integer which has been assigned the primary key.
- 'name' is a string type, which cannot be left without a value, and must be unique within the database. 
- 'stadium' is a string type. 

A slightly more complex approach was required with the relationship to the 'teams' table. As we have two foreign keys associated with a single primary key, a different method was required. Using the match model, the 'primaryjoin' expression was used with an 'or' statement, to create a relationship from the primary key, 'id' from the 'Team' model to either the foreign key 'home_team_id' or 'away_team_id'. The 'viewonly' expression aslo indicates that this is not for persisting in operations but only when loading the objects. 

### Tip Model
```
class Tip(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "tips"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    selection = db.Column(db.String)

    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    match_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("matches.id"), nullable=False)

    users = db.relationship ('User', back_populates = "tips")
    matches = db.relationship ('Match', back_populates = "tips")
```
The model 'Tip' with the table named "tips". This table and its attributes store date from the selections on matches from the user. Its columns are:
- 'id' a serial integer set as a the primary key.
- 'selection' simply a string data type, although has been validated within the schema to a tuple of valid strings.
- 'user_id' is an integer that has been set a foreign key, relating to the primary key of the 'users' table. As a foreign key it cannot be null. 
- 'match_id' is an integer that has been set a foreign key, relating to the primary key of the 'matches' table. As a foreign key it cannot be null. 

As discussed prior both the foreign keys in this table have a created relationship to the primary key in the associated table utilising SQLAlchemy. 

### Location Model
```
class Location(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "locations"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    city = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    stadium = db.Column(db.String)
    timezone = db.Column(db.String)

    matches = db.relationship("Match", back_populates="locations")
```
Finally the 'Location' model with a table named 'locations', stores the data for each location. It has a relationship with the foreign key within the 'matches' table. Its columns are:
- 'id' is a serial integer that has been set as a primary key. 
- 'city' is a string that cannot be left null.
- 'stadium' is a string data type.
- 'timezone' is a string data type. It is unable to be a datetime object as the package pytz cannot read those objects. 

## R8 Explain how to use this applicationâ€™s API endpoints. 

Comments within the applications code adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines. The comments will give a brief description in the controller about the functionality of each route and when error messages may occur. 

van Rossum W, Warsaw B, Coghlan A, 2013, PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code, https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments

## **Auth & User**

### **HTTP Method** - POST

This endpoint is designed to register a new user. 

**Route or Path** - http://localhost:8080/auth/register

**Body Required**

name: A string of maximum 100 characters

email: Must be in the format of "string"@"string"."string"

password: A string with a minimum of eight characters with at least one Integer and Alpha character. 

Example:
```
"name": "Dev 1",
"email": "dev1@email.com",
"password": "password123"
```
**Response**
```
{
	"id": 3,
	"name": "Dev 1",
	"email": "dev1@email.com",
	"is_admin": false
}
```
This has returned a new registered user. As can be seen it displays the 'id' as a serial integer, and also displays the default setting for ```is_admin`` which is 'false'.

**Example Error response** 

If attempting to register with an email that already belongs to a user, e.g "dev1@email.com". 
```
{
	"error": "Email address already in use"
}
```
If registering a user leaving a mandatory field empty, e.g no email inputted.
```
{
	"error": {
		"email": [
			"Missing data for required field."
		]
	}
}
```
If attempting to register with a password that doesn't satisfy criteria. e.g "password"
```
{
	"error": {
		"password": [
			"Minimum eight characters, at least one letter and one number"
		]
	}
}
```

### **HTTP Method** - POST

This endpoint is designed to login a registered user. 

**Route or Path** - http://localhost:8080/auth/login

**Body Required**

name: The matching string value for this object stored in the database

email: The matching string value for this object stored in the database

password: The matching string value for this object stored in the database

Example:
```
"name": "admin",
"email": "admin@email.com",
"password": "password123"
```
**Response**
```
{
	"name": "admin",
	"email": "admin@email.com",
	"is_admin": true,
	"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTcyMTg4MTkwOCwianRpIjoiZDcyMzkxMWUtNzg4NS00YTA4LTliZWYtNjkwODQxZmM0MDAwIiwidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJuYmYiOjE3MjE4ODE5MDgsImNzcmYiOiI1MGQzZTFhYi02YmE5LTRkMGQtODI5Zi0zZTVkNTNjZWQxYTciLCJleHAiOjE3MjE5NjgzMDh9.xMgSAY06__87jdpulgJVSdxcZoWjuVeTI2tzrMDjqMw"
}
```
This has returned a successful login from the user 'admin'. Unlike the above registered user, the result for ```is_admin``` is 'true', and it has also returned a JWT. This JWT is valid for 24hrs and authorises users for specific endpoints below. As this particular token belongs to an admin, authorisation is much broader as will be seen below. 

**Example Error Response**

If login uses the wrong email or password.
```
{
	"error": "Invalid email or password"
}
```

### **HTTP Method** - GET

This endpoint is designed to retrieve all users information. Authorised for admin only.

**Route or Path** - http://localhost:8080/auth/users

**Header Required**

token: The JWT from a logged in admin for authorisation:

**Response**
```
[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "admin",
		"email": "admin@email.com",
		"is_admin": true
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"name": "guest",
		"email": "guest@email.com",
		"is_admin": false
	},
	{
		"id": 3,
		"name": "Dev 1",
		"email": "dev1@email.com",
		"is_admin": false
	},
]
```
This has returned all users currently registered in the database. 

### **HTTP Method** - DELETE

Deletes a user. Must give valid JWT, therefore a user may only use this endpoint to delete themselves when logged in. 

**Route or Path** - http://localhost:8080/auth/users

**Header Required**

token: The JWT from a logged in user.

**Response**

Example: User from logged in user id "5"
```
{
	"message": "User with id '5' has been deleted"
}
```
Returns a message that the user has been deleted. 

**Example Error Response**

If not user with the id has already been deleted or does not exist.
```
{
	"error": "User not found"
}
```

### **HTTP Method** - PUT, PATCH 

Updates a users details. The user must be logged in as a valid JWT is required. 

**Route or Path** - http://localhost:8080/auth/users

**Body Required** - (Optional fields in PATCH method)

name: The matching string value stored in database

email: The matching string value stored in database

password: The matching string value stored in database

```
{
	"name": "Developer 1",
	"email": "developer1@email.com",
	"password": "123password"
} 
```
**Header Required**

token: The JWT from the logged in user, in this example "Dev 1".

**Response**
```
{
	"id": 3,
	"name": "Developer 1",
	"email": "developer1@email.com",
	"is_admin": false
}
```
Returns all the user fields with the updated fields displaying any new values.

**Example Error Response**

If the user is not found
```
{
	"error": "User does not exist"
}
```
## **Match**

### **HTTP Method** - GET

Retrieves all matches from the database.

**Route or Path** - http://localhost:8080/matches

**Response**
